What�s the difference between an STD and an STI?�,"The terms STD (sexually transmitted disease) and STI (sexually transmitted infection) are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences between them:

STD (Sexually Transmitted Disease):

Refers to a condition that has developed symptoms due to an infection. When the presence of bacteria, viruses, or parasites causes noticeable symptoms or illnesses, it is often referred to as a disease.
Examples include HIV/AIDS, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, where the infection has led to symptoms or health issues.
STI (Sexually Transmitted Infection):

Refers to the presence of an infectious agent in the body, whether or not it has developed into a disease. An individual can have an STI without showing symptoms, meaning they are infected but not necessarily ill.
Using the term STI can be more inclusive and accurate because it encompasses infections that have not progressed to the disease stage. Many infections are asymptomatic and can be spread without the infected person knowing.
